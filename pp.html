If you wish to limit the information available to us, you should visit the privacy settings of your third-party accounts to learn about your options.

Other third parties. We may receive additional information about you, such as demographic data, from third parties such as data or marketing partners and combine it with other information we have about you.

How We Use the Information We Collect
We use the information we collect:

To provide, maintain, improve, and enhance our Services;
To communicate with you, provide you with updates and other information relating to our Services, provide information that you request, respond to comments and questions, and otherwise provide customer support;
To facilitate the connection of third-party services or applications, such as social networks;
For marketing purposes, such as developing and providing promotional and advertising materials that may be useful, relevant, valuable or otherwise of interest to you;
To personalize your experience on our Services such as presenting tailored content;
To facilitate transactions and payments;
To detect and prevent fraud, and respond to trust and safety issues that may arise;
For compliance purposes, including enforcing our Terms of Service or other legal rights, or as may be required by applicable laws and regulations or requested by any judicial process or governmental agency; and
For other purposes for which we provide specific notice at the time the information is collected.
De-Identified Information. Please note that we may de-identify the information we collect from and about you so that it can no longer be reasonably linked to you or your device. Once information has been de-identified in this way, we can use and share it for any purpose in our discretion, and this Privacy Policy no longer applies to such information.

Your Privacy Obligations
Fsh provides you with the ability to publish content that could be used to collect personally identifiable information from its users. If you publish such content, it is your responsibility to understand your legal obligations and to comply with all applicable laws, including:

Providing your users with appropriate notices of their privacy rights, which should incorporate this Privacy Policy by reference.
Obtaining any necessary consent from your users for the processing, storage, use, and transfer of any of their personally identifiable information that you collect.
If applicable, providing any required notices and obtaining any required verifiable parental consent under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) or similar laws.
Complying with your legal obligations to allow your users to correct their personally identifiable information or to have it erased.
Legal Bases for Processing Information
Various global privacy laws (such as those in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Brazil) require that we have a “legal basis” to process your information. The legal bases on which we rely to process your information include:

Consent. You have consented to the use of your information, for example, where legally required, to send you marketing communications.
Contractual necessity. We need your information to provide you with the Services, for example to facilitate your registration and respond to your inquiries.
Compliance with a legal obligation. We have a legal obligation to use your information, for example to comply with tax and accounting obligations.
Legitimate interests. We have a legitimate interest in using your information for a business purpose that does not override your individual rights and interests. For example, we have a legitimate interest in using your information for product development and internal analytics purposes, to improve the accuracy of our machine learning technologies such as code generation, and otherwise to improve the safety, security, and performance of our Services.
How We Share the Information We Collect

We share information with the following categories of third parties.

Affiliates. We may share any information we receive with our corporate affiliates under common ownership or control for any of the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

Service Providers. We may share any information we receive with vendors retained in connection with the provision of our Services and that process your information on our behalf. These entities may include analytics, billing, legal support, marketing, security, machine learning, and fraud prevention companies.

Other Users and Individuals. Our Services are social services in which you can find, collaborate on, and share content. Your profile, including your name, user name, profile picture, code, and other profile information (but not your email address or phone number) will always be viewable and searchable by other users and search indexed by online search engines. The content you post to the Services, including your code and forum posts, will be displayed on the Services and viewable by other users by default. The “Your Preferences” section of this Privacy Policy describes the controls that you can use to limit the sharing of your code. We are not responsible for the other users’ use of available information, so you should carefully consider whether and what to post or how you identify yourself on the Services. Please note that student profiles created by teachers using Teams for Education and students’ code are never publicly viewable or searchable, and students may not post content on publicly viewable forums.

Third Party App Integrations. If you connect a third-party application to our Services, we may share information such as code with that third party.

As Required by Law and Similar Disclosures. We may access, preserve, and disclose your information if we believe in good faith that doing so is required or appropriate to: (a) comply with law enforcement requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoenas; (b) respond to your requests; or (c) protect your, our, or others’ rights, property, or safety. For the avoidance of doubt, the disclosure of your information may occur if you post any objectionable content on or through the Services.

Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers. We may disclose and transfer your information to service providers, advisors, potential transactional partners, or other third parties in connection with the consideration, negotiation, or completion of a corporate transaction in which we are acquired by or merged with another company or we sell, liquidate, or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets.

Consent. We may also disclose information from or about you with your permission.

Your Rights and Choices

Sharing Preferences. If you prefer to not have others see your code, you can upgrade to make that code private. If you import code from GitHub and your repository is public, it will remain public by default on Fsh. If you wish to import code from GitHub and your repository is private, you can upgrade to ensure that your code will also remain private on Fsh.

Marketing Communications. You can unsubscribe from our promotional emails via the link provided in the emails. Even if you opt-out of receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive administrative messages from us.

How to Block Cookies. You can change your browser settings to block, disable, or notify you when you receive a Cookie, delete Cookies, or browse our Services using your browser’s anonymous usage setting. However, if you use your browser settings to block all Cookies (including essential Cookies) you may not be able to access all or parts of our Services, or some portions of the Services may not function properly.

Your European Privacy Rights. If you are located in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, you have the additional rights described below.

You may request access to the information we maintain about you, update and correct inaccuracies in your information, restrict or object to the processing of your information, have the information anonymized or deleted, as appropriate, or exercise your right to data portability to easily transfer your information to another company (where technically feasible). In addition, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, including in your country of residence, place of work or where an incident took place.
You may withdraw any consent you previously provided to us regarding the processing of your information, at any time and free of charge. We will apply your preferences going forward and this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before you withdrew your consent.
You may exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details at the end of this Privacy Policy. Before responding to your request, we may ask you to provide reasonable information to verify your identity. Please note that there are exceptions and limitations to each of these rights, and that while any changes you make will be reflected in active user databases instantly or within a reasonable period of time, we may retain information for backups, archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so.

Third Parties

Our Services may contain links to other websites, products, or services that we do not own or operate. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties. Please be aware that this Privacy Policy does not apply to your activities on these third-party services or any information you disclose to these third parties. We encourage you to read their privacy policies before providing any information to them.

Retention

We take measures to delete your information or maintain it in a de-identified form when it is no longer necessary to be kept in identifiable form for the purposes for which we process it, unless we are required by law to keep this information for a longer period. When determining the specific retention period, we take into account various criteria, such as the type of service provided to you, the nature and length of our relationship with you, and mandatory retention periods provided by applicable law and any statute of limitations. When you request to delete your account, we delete your data within 30 days.

Security

We use a variety of technical, organizational, and physical safeguards designed to safeguard the information we maintain. However, as our Services are hosted electronically, we can make no guarantees as to the security or privacy of your information.

Children’s and Students’ Privacy

Our Services are directed to a general audience and are not directed to children under the age of 13. By agreeing to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service, you represent that you are allowed to use our Services according to your country’s applicable age limits. If we learn that a child is under the age of 13 in the United States, or is under the applicable age requirement in another jurisdiction, we will take reasonable steps to obtain parental consent or delete the user’s personal information from our files as soon as is practicable. Please contact us at privacy@Fsh.com if you believe that a user has provided us with representations in violation of this Privacy Policy.

COPPA compliance

Under our free Teams for Education product, we offer verified educators the opportunity to create limited Fsh accounts for students who are under the age of 13, by creating a private invite link for these students. When an account is created using this private invite link, we do not collect personal information from the account holder such as their name or email address, but only a username that does not include their real name, and persistent identifiers such as IP address and cookie data to support the internal operations of our Services. For more information, see this blog post.

FERPA compliance

FERPA protects “personally identifiable information” contained in students’ education records from unauthorized disclosure. Consistent with FERPA, we will use education records, as defined under FERPA, for the purpose of providing agreed services to a school, school district or teacher. We use or share FERPA-protected information only as directed or permitted by the school, school district, teacher, or under FERPA. If a parent or eligible student requests access to education records that are hosted on our servers, we will help facilitate such access. For more information, see our U.S. Student Data Protection Addendum and our Student Privacy Notice.
